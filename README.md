_Just Another System for Epityping using NGSs data_

>[!WARNING]
>**JASEN is in beta stage and the results are unverified. There is no guarantee that the pipeline can execute, output format consistency, or that it produces accurate results until there is an official 1.0 release.**

Jasen produces results for antibiotic resistance and virulence prediction and epidemiological typing for surveillance purposes. The pipeline has been developed for a small set of microbiota (primarily *Staphylococcus aruesu*, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, and *Eschericha coli*), but will likely work with any bacteria with a stable MLST and cgMLST scheme.

Jasen is developed in collaboration with several Swedish hospitals. The development was funded by [Genomic Medicine Sweden](https://genomicmedicine.se/).
