# Contributing to Jasen

This is a guide on how to contribute to Jasen in various ways. You can contribute to this project by reporting bugs, help implement new types of analysis, or by improving the pipeline documentation.

## Documentation changes

Propose changes to the documentation by opening a pull request.

Edit the documentation by editing the source files in the [docs](docs/) directory. The [README](docs/source/README.md) describe how to build and preview the documentation on your local machine.

## Bug reports

Submitting a bug report is one of the simplest and one of the most useful way to help out the project.

Report a bug by creating a new issue (use the *New issue* button) on the [issues page](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/jasen/issues). A good bug report should include a description of the error (with the error message) and steps on how to reproduce the error.

## New feature, analysis, or tool

We welcome suggestions on new types of analysis, bacterial species or other features to add to the pipeline. Before contributing these, please create a feature proposal on the [issues page](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/jasen/issues) so it can be discussed.
